# Creating a Module
Modules can be created on the dashboard or in the files.
##### Dashboard:
Navigate to `Module Manager` and click on `Create New Module`
Input the name and type and click `Create Module`
##### Files:
Create a new file under:
`app/modules/base` OR
`app/modules/plugins`
and name it an original name.
You've created your first module and can now go onto [creating a function](https://github.com/Johonnyy/amber/blob/main/documentation/FUNCTIONS.md).

# Editing a Module
##### Dashboard:
Navigate to `Module Manager` and click on the module you would like to edit under `Module List`
Here you can edit the file content straight from the dashboard and change the module name or delete it.
You can also get to this page by going to the edit page for any function and then at the bottom clicking `Edit Module` 
##### Files:
You can edit the module straight from the files like you would any other file

**Be sure to click `Reload Plugins` on the module manager rafter modifying a module so that it can be used.**
